A dream room is one which fits your daily needs, it is one you go “wow” at, it is one that you instantly feel relaxed in and mainly it is one which is free of the frustrations. Therefore your dream room is one where the furniture is built around your room and your lifestyle.

Bedrooms are a very personal space and therefore needs to reflect you and support your storage and usage needs. At Elegance by Design we have an extensive choice of modern, traditional and classic door styles that are of the highest quality and fitted to an exceptional standard.

We manufacture all bedroom furniture ourselves, so no need to worry about a sloped ceiling, tight spaces etc., we will make the furniture fit your room.

Regardless of the bedroom size we will make the design match your needs with clever storage solutions, dresser options and matching headboards and mirrors. Also available is a wide choice of sliding wardrobe doors.

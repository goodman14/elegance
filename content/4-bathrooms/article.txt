A dream room is one which fits your daily needs, it is one you go “wow” at, it is one that you instantly feel relaxed in and mainly it is one which is free of the frustrations. Therefore your dream room is one where the furniture is built around your room and your lifestyle.

A bathroom is an essential part of any home and needs to be fitted around you; from walk-in showers, to fitted basins and toilets, to towel rails and custom made storage. At Elegance by Design we have an extensive choice of door styles that are of the highest quality and fitted to an exceptional standard.

We manufacture all bathroom furniture so no need to worry about tight spaces, shallow depth units etc., we will make the furniture fit your room. Our fitters are fully trained to take care of all plumbing and electrical needs as well as building requirements, tiling and flooring; we also don’t use contractors meaning costs are reduced.

Bathroom products are becoming more sophisticated than ever, so whether you want a classic or contemporary finish; for an en-suite or family bathroom, the quality and fitting will not be compromised.

Please come and visit our showroom (173a Annesley Road) where we have bathroom room displays and samples highlighting a selection of doors, worktops, handles and bathroom products, to inspire your new bathroom design. Also you can book a free design visit where we can bring out samples and suggest a style to complement your house. Check out our “How we work page” to see what our design service is about.
